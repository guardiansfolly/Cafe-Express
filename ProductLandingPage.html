 <!-- 1335 23Jun19: finished section 1 and the about the company part. still need to touch up section 2 and section 3. Before i move on to section 2 and 3, I need to come up with a solution for the navigation buttons. previously had a gradient but wasn't satisfied with the gradient. going to move to a :hover style rather than gradient. will continue later. -->
